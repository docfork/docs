**Docfork** bridges the gap between your AI's training data (which is months old) and the code you are writing today.

## The Problem: Expired Knowledge

AI coding assistants (Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5) are powerful, but they suffer from a critical flaw: **The Knowledge Cutoff.**

- **Outdated Code:** They suggest patterns from 2024 for frameworks released yesterday.
- **Hallucinations:** They guess APIs that don't exist.
- **Broken Builds:** You waste hours debugging "working" code that is actually deprecated.

## The Solution: Live Context

Docfork works as a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that sits between your editor and the AI.

1. **You Prompt:** `How do I use the new Next.js 15 'after()' API?`
2. **We Fetch:** Docfork searches the official documentation in < 1 second.
3. **AI Codes:** The documentation is injected into the context window, allowing the AI to write perfect, up-to-date code.
