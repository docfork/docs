description: Install Docfork MCP in Emdash
---

[Emdash](https://github.com/generalaction/emdash) is an orchestration layer for running multiple coding agents in parallel.

**What Emdash provides:**

* Global toggle: Settings → MCP → "Enable Docfork MCP"
* Per-workspace enable: The Docfork button in the ProviderBar

**What you still need to do:**
Configure your coding agent (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to connect to Docfork MCP. Emdash does not modify your agent's config.

See the [Emdash repository](https://github.com/generalaction/emdash) for more information.
