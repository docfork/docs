You shouldn't have to remember to type `use docfork`. By adding a **Rule** to your editor, you can force the AI to check documentation automatically before generating code.

### Cursor

Create a new file at `.cursor/rules/docfork-policy.md`:

```markdown title=".cursor/rules/docfork-policy.md"

You have access to the docfork MCP server. To ensure the code you write is accurate and up-to-date, you must follow these requirements:

1. Auto-Invoke: Always use `docfork_search_docs` tool when asked for library implementation, API setup, or debugging.
2. Context Strategy:
   - Search: Call `docfork_search_docs` tool. Review the `content` snippets in the results.
   - Read: Only call `docfork_read_url` tool if the search snippets are incomplete or you need the full file context for a complex implementation.
   - Identity: Use the `docforkIdentifier` in follow-up searches to narrow results to a specific library.

If you are unsure of a library's latest syntax, search with docfork first.
```

### Claude Code (CLI)

Add this block to your `CLAUDE.md` file in the root of your repository:

```markdown title="CLAUDE.md"
## Tool Usage Rules

- **Docfork MCP**: Always use the `docfork` tool when I ask about external libraries, API syntax, or configuration.
- Prioritize Docfork results over your internal training data for frameworks I use.
```

### Windsurf / Other Agents

If your editor supports a global system prompt or custom instructions, paste the **Context Strategy** text above into the main text area.

<Callout type="info" title="Why use Rules?">
  Rules turn Docfork from a "Search Engine" into an "Index." Without rules, the
  AI guesses. With rules, the AI verifies.
