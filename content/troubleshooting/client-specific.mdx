## MCP Client-Specific Issues

### Cursor

- Make sure you're using Cursor 2.0.0 or later for the best MCP support
- Try both global (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`) and project-specific (`.cursor/mcp.json`) configurations
- Restart & Update Cursor after changing the MCP configuration

### VS Code

- Ensure you have the latest version of VS Code with MCP support
- Check that the Copilot extension is installed and updated
- Restart & Update VS Code after configuration changes

### Claude Code

- Verify the MCP server is added correctly with `claude mcp list`
- Check logs with `claude mcp logs docfork`
- Try removing and re-adding the server
